title: About Me
---

My name is Rubén Fernández. I have been developing software professionally since 1998, mainly web development. In that time, I've done a
bit of everything, from database design to UI design, from backend to frontend coding, from PHP to Node.js to Haskell.

In this blog I hope to communicate some of the ideas and insights I have gained over the years.
